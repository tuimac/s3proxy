# s3proxy
You can't access the URL which is generated by the Amazon S3 website hosting service from a completely private network because the URL is associated with a public IP address.<br>
So how do we access it? I think one of the answers is that you create the reverse proxy server like Nginx but I tried to build API Gateway as a reverse proxy.<br>
Once you build it, the building environment is much easier than installing Nginx to EC2 instance.

## Technology
Private API Gateway associate with VPC Endpoint(com.amazonaws.REGION.execute-api). Then you can access API Gateway privately.

## Prerequisite
Check below envirionment.
- Create AWS Account.([Guide](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/?nc1=h_ls))
- Install AWS CLI on your machine.([Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html))
- Create IAM User or IAM Role for executing AWS CLI.([IAM user Creation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html), [IAM role Creation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html))

You need to attach 'AdministratorAccess' which is AWS managed IAM policy to IAM role or user you created.

## How to use
Just execute AWS CLI below.
```
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name s3proxy --region <Your region code> --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM --template-body file://template.yml
```
Then you can create the environment like this below.
